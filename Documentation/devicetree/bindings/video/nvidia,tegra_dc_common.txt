NVIDIA Tegra Display Controller

The Tegra Display Hardware (DC) provides an engine for display processing
pipeline with support of format conversion, scaling, rotation of display
content with supporting different protocols for display pipeline.

This tegra_dc_common node is used for mainly initializing chip-level information
about display HW, such as the total number of heads, windows, and SORs.
It is also used for retrieval of the static IMP table from device tree.
Rest of details for Tegra DC are given in ./nvidia,tegrat194-dc.txt

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be "nvidia,tegra_dc_common".
- reg: The physical base address and length of the address spaces for all heads.
  For T194, the physical base address should be that of HEAD0, and
  the length should be 0x40000 to cover HEAD0 - HEAD3.
- nvidia,valid_heads: This is a legacy property that is carried over from T186.
  It must be set to 0x0.
- nvidia,disp_imp_table: This table contains static IMP (Is Mode Possible)
  settings for different display configurations. IMP is essentially a SW/HW
  feature that programs display's bandwidth resources so that the display pipeline
  doesn't underflow.

Example:
=======

SoC DTSI:
--------

dc_common {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra_dc_common";
	reg = <0x0 0x15200000 0x0 0x40000>;
	nvidia,valid_heads = <0x0>;
	nvidia,disp_imp_table = <&disp_imp_table>;
};
