* Device tree binding for Nvidia Tegra18x cpufreq driver for EDVD device
--------------------------------------------

This document defines the device-specific binding for the Tegra18x cpufreq
driver. It should not contain bindings for generic tegra cpufreq driver
which are common across all the tegra cpufreq platform driver.

The Tegra18x cpufreq driver adjusts CPU frequency by writing voltage and
freq hint in EDVD per core volt freq request registers. It calculates per
core cpufreq by reading per core cycle counters. Cycles are measured by
reading EDVD per core clock count registers and divided by ref clock counter.
The ressult is multiplied by ref clock.

Tegra18x cpufreq driver considers these EDVD registers as device to measure
and adjust cpu freq. There is one instance of EDVD for the Denver cluster
and one for the A57 cluster.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "nvidia,tegra18x-cpufreq".
- reg: an array of four 64-bit unsigned integers:
       the base address and size for Denver EDVD aperture and the base
       address and size for the A57 EDVD aperture.

- status: "okay" or "disabled" to enable/disable the node.

Example:
--------
       cpufreq@e070000 {
               compatible = "nvidia,tegra18x-cpufreq";
               reg = <0x0 0x0e070000 0x0 0x1000>, /* M/Denver cluster */
                     <0x0 0x0e060000 0x0 0x1000>; /* B/ARM cluster */
               status = "disabled";
       };
