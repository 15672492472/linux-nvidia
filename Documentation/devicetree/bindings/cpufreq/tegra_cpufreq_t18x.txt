tegra cpufreq EDVD device for t18x
-----------------------------

This is the placeholder for t18x specific hw bindings for tegra cpufreq
driver. It should not contain bindings for generic tegra cpufreq driver
which are common across all the tegra cpufreq platform driver.

tegra18x CPU frequency can be adjusted by writes to the device called EDVD.
There is one instance of EDVD for the Denver cluster and one for the A57
cluster.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "nvidia,tegra18x-edvd".
- reg: an array of four 64-bit unsigned integers:
       the base address and size for Denver EDVD aperture and the base
       address and size for the A57 EDVD aperture.
- status: "okay" or "disabled" to enable/disable the node.

Optional properties:

Example:
--------
       tegra_edvd {
               compatible = "nvidia,tegra18x-edvd";
               reg = <0x0 0x0e070000 0x0 0x1000>, /* M/Denver cluster */
                     <0x0 0x0e060000 0x0 0x1000>; /* B/ARM cluster */
               status = "disabled";
       };
