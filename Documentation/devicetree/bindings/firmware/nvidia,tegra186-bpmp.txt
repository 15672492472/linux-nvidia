NVIDIA Tegra Boot and Power Management Processor (BPMP)

The BPMP is a specific processor in Tegra chip, which is designed for
booting process handling and offloading the power management, clock
management, and reset control tasks from the CPU. The binding document
defines the resources that would be used by the BPMP firmware driver,
which can create the interprocessor communication (IPC) between the CPU
and BPMP.

Required properties:
- name : Should be bpmp
- compatible
    Array of strings
    One of:
    - "nvidia,tegra186-bpmp"
- dma-coherent: Must be present
- #power-domain-cells : Should be 1.
- #strap-cells: Should be 1
- #nvidia,controller-id-cells: Should be 1
- iommus: Phandle to the SMMU specifier
- reg: Three { base-address, size } pairs where first pair contains the
  bpmp register space, the second containing IPC TX shared memory and
  the third containing IPC RX shared memory.


Example:

	bpmp: bpmp {
		compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-bpmp";
		iommus = <&smmu TEGRA_SID_BPMP>;
		dma-coherent;
		reg = <0x0 0x0d000000 0x0 0x00800000>,
			<0x0 0x4004e000 0x0 0x00001000>,
			<0x0 0x4004f000 0x0 0x00001000>;
		status = "disabled";
		#power-domain-cells = <1>;
		#strap-cells = <1>;
		#nvidia,controller-id-cells = <1>;

		bpmpthermal {
			...
		};
	};
