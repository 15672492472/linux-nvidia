* NVIDIA Tegra Hardware Synchronization Primitives (HSP) bindings

Tegra HSP unit is designed to support synchronization among processors on the
SOC for various tasks where shared resources need to be accessed exclusively
or inter-processor communications support.

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "nvidia,tegra186-hsp"

- reg: base address and length of the HSP aperture

- interrupts: CPU's doorbell interrupt

- nvidia,num-SM: number of shared mailboxes

- nvidia,num-AS: number of arbitrated semaphores

- nvidia,num-SS: number of shared semaphores

- nvidia,num-DB: number of doorbells

- nvidia,num-SI: number of shared interrupts

Symbolic doorbell constants are defined in:
