NVIDIA Tegra19x CBB NOC driver
==================================

This document defines the device-specific binding for the Tegra19x CBB NOC driver.

Control Backbone (CBB) comprises of the physical path from a master (or initiator)
to a slave’s (or target) register configuration space(Target’s Control Space).
CBB has multiple hierarchical sub-NOC's(Network-on-Chip) and stretches to various
master and slave partitions using different bridges like AXIP2P, AXI2APB.

This driver handles SError's from Control Backbone(CBB) to CCPLEX.
SError will be reported in case of failed transaction in bridge within CBB.
The driver prints relevant debug information like Error Code, Error Description,
Master, Address, AXI ID, Cache, Protection, Security Group etc in case of a
bridge error using CBB's Error Logger registers.

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be "nvidia,tegra194-CBBNOCAXI-bridge"
- reg: Physical base address and length of registers

Example:
========
cbbnocaxi@2100000 {
                 compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-CBBNOCAXI-bridge";
                 reg = <0x0 0x02300000 0x0 0x1000>;
                 status = "okay";
};
