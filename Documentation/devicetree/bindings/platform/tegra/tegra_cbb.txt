NVIDIA Tegra19x CBB NOC driver
==================================

This document defines the device-specific binding for Tegra19x CBB NOC driver.

Control Backbone(CBB) comprises of the physical path from a master(or initiator)
to a slave’s(or target) register configuration space(Target’s Control Space).
CBB has multiple hierarchical sub-NOC's(Network-on-Chip) and stretches to
various master and slave partitions using different bridges like AXIP2P,AXI2APB.

This driver handles Error's from Control Backbone(CBB) in case of failed
transaction in bridge within CBB. For access frorm CCPLEX master, SError
will be reported. For access by other masters, issuing master will get abort
and interrupt will be reported to CCPLEX.

The driver prints relevant debug information like Error Code, Error Description,
Master, Address, AXI ID, Cache, Protection, Security Group etc on receiving
SError or interrupt due to bridge error using CBB's Error Logger registers.

Required properties:

- compatible: Should be "nvidia,tegra194-CBBNOCAXI-bridge"
- reg: Physical base address and length of registers

Example:
========
cbbnocaxi@2100000 {
                 compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-CBBNOCAXI-bridge";
                 reg = <0x0 0x02300000 0x0 0x1000>;
                 status = "okay";
};
