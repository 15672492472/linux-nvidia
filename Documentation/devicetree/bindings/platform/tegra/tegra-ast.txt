* NVIDIA Tegra Address Space Translation (AST) bindings

Tegra AST unit converts any auxiliary CPUs' local AXI PA space
(it is not the CCPLEX PA space) to either Physical or virtual MC
Address space. i.e. its local slave address to either PA or
if SMMU enabled then to IOVA.

== AST Device Nodes ==

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "nvidia,tegra186-ast" for T18x.

- reg: base address and length of the AST aperture

Possible example:

some_device_ast0: ast@b040000 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-ast";
	reg = <0 0x0b040000 0 0x10000>;
};

some_device_ast1: ast@b050000 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra186-ast";
	reg = <0 0x0b050000 0 0x10000>;

};

== Clients ==

Clients that use an AST must define a property that contains
the phandle of the AST device.
The name of this property is defined by the client's binding.

A possible example is:

some_device {
	nvidia,ast0 = <&some_device_ast0>;
	nvidia,ast1 = <&some_device_ast1>;
};

Or only single property can contain mutliple AST phandles, like:

some_device {
	nvidia,ast = <&some_device_ast0>, <&some_device_ast1>;
};
